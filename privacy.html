                    <h1>6. <br> THIRD-PARTY LINKS AND INTEREST-BASED MARKETING</h1>
                    Links. There are a number of places on the Services where you may click on a link to access other platforms or websites
                    that do not operate under this Privacy Statement. For example, if you click on an advertisement or a third-party logo on
                    the Services, you may be taken to a website that we do not control. These third-party platforms or websites may
                    independently solicit and collect information, including personal information, from you. We are not responsible for the
                    privacy practices of these platforms and websites and cannot guarantee the security of any user data collected there. We
                    recommend that you consult the privacy statements of all third-party platforms and websites you visit by clicking on the
                    "privacy" link typically located at the bottom of the web page you are visiting.
                    
                    Interest-Based Marketing. We contract with advertising agencies, marketing partners and other service providers to serve
                    advertisements when you visit our website or other websites across the Internet. The advertisements placed on these
                    websites may use tracking technologies, such as Cookies and web beacons, to collect information about your visits to
                    this and other websites. We may also share information with these companies (including in aggregate form) and/or partner
                    with these companies to provide interest-based advertising both on and off websites operated by Prerna Pvt. Ltd. India In either
                    case, the purpose of the sharing is to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you,
                    to analyze and improve the effectiveness of ads and emails, and to improve and enhance our website and its content.
                    
                    Do Not Track. The Prerna Pvt. Ltd. India website is not currently configured to recognize “do not track” signals sent as a header
                    by Internet browsers. However, other settings within your browser may permit you to block Cookies or other technology
                    that enable websites to collect information that can be used to tailor advertisements to your interest. Please check
                    your browser’s settings or consult your browser’s help information for more details. To learn more about browser
                    tracking signals and Do Not Track please visit www.allaboutdnt.org.
                    
                    <h1>7. <br> USER GENERATED CONTENT</h1>
                    We may provide areas on the Services where you can, for example, post product reviews or reviews about our website, ask
                    or answer a question, communicate with others, and upload content (e.g., pictures, videos, audio files). Such postings,
                    which may be administered by our service providers, are governed by our general Terms of Use and may also be subject to
                    more specific terms that are integrated into that area of the Services. Service providers administering the postings may
                    use tracking technology, such as Cookies, to collect information, and geolocation data, about your posting.
                    Additionally, such postings may appear on other websites when searches are executed on the subject of your posting.
                    Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable web pages, that information can be
                    collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We
                    cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we
                    encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information.
                    
                    The Services may also include features that involve a shared platform with third-party services while you are on our
                    websites. For example, we may allow you to sign in to your account on a social networking service to share your favorite
                    Prerna products or other information about Prerna with friends on that service. If we offer or accommodate this kind of
                    shared-platform or similar service, the company through which the service is provided, and with whom your information
                    may be shared, will be identified by a recognizable icon. If you choose to use the service, information collected from
                    you while you use our website may be transmitted to the company that operates the service. Additionally, once that
                    information is shared with that company, its use of information about you will be subject to that company's privacy
                    policy. Finally, your activity on any social networking service pages that, for example, refer to Prerna Pvt. Ltd. India, include
                    the Prerna logo, or involve a Prerna promotion, is guided by the general terms of the service operator or any specific
                    terms for that promotion. You therefore should consult that company's privacy policy to understand how your information
                    may be used and shared by that company.
                    
                    <h1>8. <br> SECURITY</h1>
                    When you submit information to Prerna Pvt. Ltd. India through the Services, you should be aware that your information is
                    transmitted across multiple computer systems on the Internet. Although we take reasonable and appropriate steps to
                    protect your information, no method of transmitting or storing electronic data on the Internet is ever completely
                    secure, and we do not guarantee the security of such information at any time.
                    
                    <h1>9. <br> TRANSFER TO OTHER COUNTRIES</h1>
                    While Prerna Pvt. Ltd. India is a Indian company, we may collect and you may provide us with information wherever you are located.

                    jurisdictions. By using the Services, or providing us with any information, you understand that the collection,
                    processing, maintenance, transfer and storage of such information will occur in the United States, Germany and other
                    countries where the privacy laws may be different from those in the country where you reside or are located, and waive
                    any claims relating to the collection, processing, maintenance, transfer or storage of data outside of such country.
                    
                    <h1>10. <br> RIGHT TO MODIFY THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT</h1>
                    Prerna Pvt. Ltd. India reserves the right to modify this Privacy Statement at any time at its sole discretion. If we modify the
                    Privacy Statement, we will post the revised statement here, with an updated revision date. Changes will be effective
                    immediately (except for material changes) upon the posting of the revised Privacy Statement on the Services. In the
                    event we make material changes to this Privacy Statement, we will notify you through the Services prior to the changes
                    taking effect. Please note that if you do not agree to the modified Privacy Statement, you may not use the Services.
                    Your continued use of the Services following the posting of the changes or any applicable notice period will mean that
                    you accept those changes.

                    In addition to the collection and usage practices described in this Privacy Statement, this information applies to the
                    software and services associated with certain Prerna devices and certain cloud solutions and services offered by Prerna.
                    Prerna Pvt. Ltd. India collects and uses device information and in some instances registered user-specific information in the

                    Device Diagnostics, Analytics and Updates. In order to improve our product and service offerings, your device may
